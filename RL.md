## Open Source Packages
1. [Godot RL Agents](https://github.com/edbeeching/godot_rl_agents/tree/main): An Open Source Package that allows video game creators, AI researchers and hobbyists the opportunity to learn complex behaviors for their Non Player Characters or agents

2. [UnrealMLAgents](https://github.com/AlanLaboratory/UnrealMLAgents): The Unreal ML Agents Toolkit is an open-source project that enables Unreal Engine games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents using deep reinforcement learning. This project is a port of Unity ML-Agents, adapted to work within Unreal Engine.
